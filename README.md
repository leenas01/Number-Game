# 🎮 Number Guessing Game

A simple Java-based number guessing game developed as part of the CodSoft Java Internship. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the correct number with hints provided after each attempt.

## 💡 Features
- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- User input handling
- Feedback system: Too high / Too low / Correct
- Attempt tracking
- Option to play multiple rounds

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- Scanner (for input handling)
- Random class

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/number-game.git`
2. Open the project in your IDE
3. Compile and run the `NumberGuessingGame.java` file

## 📚 Learning Outcome
This project helped me understand user input, random number generation, control structures, and loop-based game logic in Java.
